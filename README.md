# btop Activity for Omarchy Quattro

Brings btop back to the Omarchy bar: live CPU, RAM, and GPU usage and
temperatures, with btop one click away.

## Some features

- applies settings live to the running btop plugin
- preserves Omarchy's btop theme without touching the normal user `btop.conf`

## Quickstart

After installation:

- **left-click** bar icon to start/focus btop in the selected window mode
- **right-click** bar icon to open the plugin settings
  - choose **Settings** to change plugin and btop options
  - choose **Help** to open built-in help in the selected window mode
- **hover over it** to see RAM use, CPU use and temperature, and GPU use,
  temperature, and vRAM

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/omarchy-QOL/omarchy-btop-activity --enable
```

Omarchy includes btop by default. On AMD systems, btop's own GPU panel also
needs the distribution's ROCm SMI library (`rocm-smi-lib` on Arch).

## Use

The plugin reads GPU telemetry from the kernel driver, using the same AMD
sysfs vRAM files and NVIDIA NVML memory call as btop. If a sensor is missing,
the hover shows `unavail.` for temperature and `unavail. (vRAM)` for memory.
Intel integrated GPUs typically have no dedicated vRAM, so that field stays
unavailable. If something fails here, GPU and driver combinations can be
messy, so feel free to file an issue.

AMD usage and temperature are read directly from DRM sysfs. Intel usage is
sampled from per-client DRM accounting and works immediately after installation.
NVIDIA uses NVML through a narrow helper that can be built once with:

```bash
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/ilyazar.btop/setup-gpu-helper.sh
```

The NVIDIA helper is built locally and runs without elevated privileges.
Building requires a C compiler and the official driver's `libnvidia-ml` library.
Intel integrated GPUs commonly expose package temperature rather than a
separate GPU sensor, so temperature and vRAM can remain unavailable even
while usage is working. Rebuild the NVIDIA helper to pick up vRAM there too.

## Demo

See btop launch from the bar, switch between floating and tiled layouts, apply a
250 ms refresh interval live, and update its keybinding.

## Settings

The plugin keeps a short list of useful controls before opening btop:

| Setting         | Choices                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Tray icon       | Meters, CPU, Pulse, or a custom image    |
| Keybindings     | opens the Omarchy user bindings file     |
| Window mode     | floating or tiled                        |
| Update interval | any whole number from 100 ms to one day  |
| Process sorting | lazy CPU, direct CPU, memory, or program |
| Process tree    | on or off                                |

For the update interval, press Enter or click the value to edit it. Left/Right
(or `h`/`l`) change it by 1 ms. Up/Down (or `k`/`j`) move through 250, 500,
1000, 2000, and 5000 ms while still letting you type any value in btop's full
range. From a custom value, they jump to the next preset above or below it and
wrap around at the ends.

Edit `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua` directly, or select **Keybindings** in the
plugin settings to open it. The button prefers Neovim, jumping to an existing
Activity override or to the end of the file; without Neovim, it uses Omarchy's
config editor.

Omarchy assigns `Super+Ctrl+T` to btop by default. To replace it, e.g. with
`Super+Ctrl+Alt+g`, add:

```lua
hl.unbind("SUPER + CTRL + T")
o.bind("SUPER + CTRL + ALT + G", "Activity", { tui = "btop" })
```

After Hyprland reloads, the settings row shows the effective shortcut, or
`Unbound` when no Activity binding remains.

Cycle **Tray icon** through **Meters**, **CPU**, **Pulse**, and **Custom**. The
default CPU icon follows the bar's normal foreground color. The custom path is
stored separately, so switching between styles does not discard it. **CPU** is
the default for new installations.

For **Custom**, enter an absolute path, a `~/path`, or a `file://` URL, then
press Enter or **Save**. SVG and PNG work well. The plugin renders the file
as-is and does not recolor it. An invalid path shows `!`.

Depending on the installed icon themes, useful paths include:

- `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/btop.svg`
- `/usr/share/icons/HighContrast/scalable/apps/utilities-system-monitor.svg`
- `/usr/share/icons/Yaru/scalable/apps/system-monitor-app-symbolic.svg`

Plugin choices are stored in Omarchy's `shell.json` and survive shell restarts.

Under **Appearance**, choose whether btop opens tiled or floating. The setting
applies to both left-click and Help. Floating is the default and restores
Omarchy's centered 875 x 600 window size when selected.

## Config safety and troubleshooting

The plugin stores its choices in Omarchy's `shell.json` and generates a private
btop config under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`. The normal user `btop.conf` is never read
or written.

The runtime file is created from Omarchy's packaged btop config. Quickshell
writes it atomically, and a running btop receives its supported config-reload
signal only after a successful change. Disabling or removing the plugin restores
a file that existed before the plugin was enabled, or removes the file it
created.

GPU temperature and vRAM depend on driver support. If unavailable, the hover
says `unavail.` or `unavail. (vRAM)`. For AMD temperature monitoring in btop,
install ROCm SMI:

```bash
sudo pacman -S rocm-smi-lib
```

Then restart btop. This can matter for AMD GPUs like the Radeon RX 6400.

## Remove

```bash
omarchy plugin remove ilyazar.btop
```

Removing the plugin removes its private btop settings. It does not remove btop
or change btop's normal configuration.

## Development

Link this repository into the local plugin folder and enable it:

```bash
ln -s "$PWD" ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/ilyazar.btop
omarchy-shell shell rescanPlugins
omarchy plugin enable ilyazar.btop --section right
```

`Service.qml` owns system sampling and the native Quickshell config bridge.
`BarWidget.qml` owns the bar icon, menu, and navigation.
